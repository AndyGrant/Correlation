1. d4 { From the official site: Due to a COVID-19 contamination in his inner circle, the tournament organisation (after consultation with the chief arbiter) has asked Dubov to play wearing a face mask, in order to protect his opponent, Anish Giri. Dubov did not show for his match, which means that he has lost his game by forfeit. Dubov has indicated that he refuses to play wearing a face mask as a matter of principle. } 1-0
